It is your first week on the job as an entry-level data scientist (Jane Smith in this
scenario) at Nordic Sensor Company (NSC), a top-five player in the IoT sensor space
focusing on energy consumption and production. You have been staffed on the
Manufacturing Analytics team; in particular, you will be working on the manufacturing
process for InSense energy tracking sensor, NSCâ€™s newest offering in the residential
energy usage space.
In early-stage development testing, about 1-2% failure rate was normal for
manufacturing the InSense sensor. As you can see from the email exchange, your
supervisor, Vince, has provided you with an email introduction to the problem and
included a forwarded message from the VP of InSense communicating the current
sensor failure rate is 15% as well as more details about the data you have available.
Vince has tried some Chi-squares testing to identify the cause (specific part) or source
(specific manufacturer) to no avail. As you can imagine, the cause of increased failures
could be due to a combination of faulty parts and poor manufacturing, or it could be
specific to one factory.
The company needs to know which manufacturer to shutdown or parts supplier to stop
buying from in order to get the failure rate back down below 5%. Think about how you
can frame the problem to identify the culprit of the increase in sensor failures. There is also an organizational chart below the email exchange to help you identify the key
people you need to communicate with and work with while solving this problem.
