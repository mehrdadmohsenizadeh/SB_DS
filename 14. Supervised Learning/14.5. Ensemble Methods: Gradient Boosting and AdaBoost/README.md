# Case Study - Gradient Boosting

In this exercise, you will gain a full understanding of how <b>Gradient Boosting</b> works to improve predictions based on information from the residuals. First, you'll apply this method to a regression problem then to a classification problem using the <b>Titanic dataset</b> (<code><b>../data/titanic.csv</b></code>) .
