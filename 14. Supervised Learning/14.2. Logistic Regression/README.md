* This notebook is intended to be a general reference that can be used when working on building models for practical applications that are modeled as classification problems. As such, it contains general data science and programming patterns that can be used in many (classification) scenarios. However, it also contains some comments that are applicable to general supervised problems (i.e., regression and classification).

* Having said this, the work that is required from students consists of short exercises marked as <b>Checkup Exercise Set I, II, III, IV</b>.

  1. We recommend that you first read the whole notebook to understand the general context (i.e., classification problems) and then work on giving specific answers to the exercises.

  2. After this, we recommend that you continue using this notebook as a reference when working on other classification problems (e.g., in your capstone projects and other case studies), and consider how/if the patterns presented here can be applied to the specific practical problem at hand.

  3. Do not hesitate to discuss any questions that you might have about this notebook with your mentor and the Springboard community.
