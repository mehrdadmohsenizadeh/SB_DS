# Case Study - Random Forest

Data science plays a vital role in how we understand and react to real-world situations. It can help us understand the likelihood of an event occurring and inform decisions about how to respond to that event. Being able to understand data is particularly important in the fields of health and science. In this case study, you'll use <b>Random Forest</b> to understand the scope of the <b>Coronavirus</b> using data from December and January of 2020. This case study is an excellent example of how data scientists can help share crucial insights about occurrences that have an impact around the world.
