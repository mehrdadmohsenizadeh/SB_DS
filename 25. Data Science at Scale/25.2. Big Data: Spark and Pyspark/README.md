## Note

I have uploaded the main notebook file as a ZIP archive due to its large size (35 MB).

## How to Use

1. Download the ZIP file from the link above.
2. Extract the contents of the ZIP file to your local machine.
3. Open the extracted .ipynb file in your chosen editor or environment.
4. Run the notebook and explore the code and results.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or encounter any issues. Enjoy exploring the project!
