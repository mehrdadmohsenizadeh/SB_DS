<h1>Project Overview</h1>

Here is the question you are trying to solve while working on this case study:<br></br>
<b>Which borough of London has seen the greatest average increase in housing prices over
the (approximately) two decades covered by the dataset?</b>

<h1>Context</h1>
A borough is just a fancy word for district. There are 32 London boroughs within Greater
London, and each borough has its own governing council. As you can guess, some of
them are more desirable to live in and will reflect that desirability in a greater rise in
housing prices.

<h1>Project Tiers</h1>
There are three versions of this case study that you can work on. However, you will
ultimately need to complete Tier Three to pass this assessment.
